###La Cura

A single level tower defense game. 

This simple game is written with an early version of Niktino, which is included within the game. 

You can drag the view by moving the mouse while click is kept pressed.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The ultimate goal of the game is to kill the "Mother Virus" which is releasing it's little buddies to destroy your adn!

You MUST stop them by sending your best cell troopers to fight'em back!

Just wait until you have enough ADN to create a soldier, you can choose which one will be, and do not release cells like if you're insane! think about your next move, i'll give you a hint, the smallest and cheapest cells are inmune to enemy's projectiles, but they are very weak against "normal" viruses...

So, I Hope you get better! and have fun!
